<b> Lab | <b> Programming for Problem Solving
<b> Experiment|     <b> WAP that checks whether the two numbers entered by the user are equal or not.


<a name="LO"></a>
#### 1. Focus Area :Reinforce Theoretical  Concept

The user re-register their previously learnt theoreritical concepts by seeing it visually and by their working along with the simulator understanding the programming in c language .finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to find two numbers are equal or not. | [Evaluating](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [compare](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)
2.| User will be able to understand two numbers are equal or not.  | [Understand](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [Explain](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)
3.| User will be able to understand the operator.  | [Understand](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php) | [Demonstrate](http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/vlabs-dev/document.php)

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem based expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> The user will be able to interact with the simulator while operating the operation on the simulator we have propose problem based instructional strategy based on project aim to check whether the number entered by the user are equal or not.We have also focus on the learning objective that all the objective should be completed as proposed in our project.     </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to check whether the two numbers entered by the user are equal or not.| On the simulator screen, students will be able to give input of two numbers in the text box and submit the value for the comparison of the numbers performed by the simulator. | Compare the provided numbers to get the result 
2.| User will be able to compare the entered number with the help of operator.  | On the simulator screen, students will be able to select the operator as their choice and provide the input in to get the result.|Compare the provided numbers using different operators
3.| User will be able to understand the operator.  | On the simulator screen, students will be able to select the operator, according to the operator animation is displayed.|What user understand with the operator 
4.| User will be able to understand the c program for comparing to numbers. |  On the simulator screen select operator to get the c code which will be displayed in code section.|What user knows about comparing of two numbers using c language.

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student clicks on the simulation tab. | Simulator screen of the experiment will open up. | To open screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will select the operator they want to perform the comparison of two numbers. | The input boxes for the chosen comparison will appear on the simulator’s screen.| Open the desired comparison setup.
3.| Student will provide the input in the simulator. | On Simulator screen it will accept the input provided by the user. | To show the internal operation
4.| Click on  the Result button| Simulator performs the comparison operation to display the result.  | Generate result for the selected operator.
