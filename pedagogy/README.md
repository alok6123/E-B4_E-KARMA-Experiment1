#### 1. Focus Area :Reinforce Mathematical Concept
In this problem solving approach we check whether the two numbers entered by the user are equal or not using some instructional methodology for implementation of computation using equal to operator (==) and by difference of numbers (a-b=0 same) and more.
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem based expository
###### Assessment Method: Practical based

<u> <b>Description: </b> This experiment enables the students to understand the concept to check two numbers are equal or not. It offers students a chance to gain deeper learning of the numbers how the numbers equal or not by providing input of two numbers  to the simulator and compare the expected result and observed result that they are equal or not. </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to check whether the two numbers entered by the user are equal or not.| On the simulator screen, students will be able to give input of two numbers in the text box and submit the value for the comparison of the numbers performed by the simulator. | Compare the provided numbers to get the result 
2.| User will be able to compare the entered number with the help of operator.  | On the simulator screen, students will be able to select the operator as their choice and provide the input in to get the result.|Compare the provided numbers using different operators

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student clicks on the simulation tab. | Simulator screen of the experiment will open up. | To open screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Student will select the operator they want to perform the comparison of two numbers. | The input boxes for the chosen comparison will appear on the simulator’s screen.| Open the desired comparison setup.
3.| Student will provide the input in the simulator. | On Simulator screen it will accept the input provided by the user. | To show the internal operation
4.| Click on  the Result button| Simulator performs the comparison operation to display the result.  | Generate result for the selected operator.
