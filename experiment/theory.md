The experiment uses c language there are many operators available in the language. In this experiment we are focusing on the equal to (==), minus ( - ) and XOR operator to check whether the number entered by the user are equal or not.<br> 
I.	Equal to operator:<br>

To check whether the number is equal or not :
I.	Input two numbers A and B.
II.	Use equal to operator (==) to check.
III.	Example:- A==B (A=5 and B=5)
IV.	5==5
V.	Result: A and B are equal.
II.	Minus operator:
To check whether the number is equal or not :
I.	Input two numbers A and B.
II.	Use minus operator (-) to check.
III.	Example:- A-B (A=10 and B=5)
IV.	10-5=5 (A-B=0 to be equal)
V.	Result: A  and B are not equal.
Algorithm:

   START
   Step 1 → Take two integer variables, say A & B
   Step 2 → Assign values to variables
   Step 3 → Compare variables if A is greater than B
   Step 4 → If true print A is greater than B
   Step 5 → If false print A is not greater than B
   STOP


Formula:
•	A==B (Equal to)
•	A-B (Minus)
•	A^B (XOR)
